<h1>How Lenders Rate Creditworthiness</h1>
<p>Lenders must evaluate the risks of lending money to others. In commercial lending, creditors generally follow the same principles to evaluate a borrower's creditworthiness.</p>
<p>A creditor usually looks at three factors known as the "three Cs": capacity, capital, and character.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Capacity</strong>. The present and future ability to meet your financial obligations. Some of the areas examined would be your work history and the amount of debt that you already owe.</li>
<li>
<strong>Capital</strong>. Savings and other assets that could be used as collateral for loans. Even if you are not required to post collateral, many creditors express a preference that you have assets other than income that could be used to repay a loan.</li>
<li>
<strong>Character</strong>. This boils down to trustworthiness, promptness in paying your existing bills and other debts, and your credit history.</li>
</ul>
<p>In days of old, the "three Cs" may have been all that were needed to get the nod on a loan, but in today's information age, much more is required, such as a credit report and credit score.</p>
<p>The credit report represents a long list of a person's payment history, credit accounts, and other information. The credit report itself is available free, but the credit score is not included.  Perhaps more important is one's credit score&mdash;called a FICO score&mdash;which is named after the company that developed it: Fair Isaac and Company (<a href="http://www.myfico.com/">www.myfico.com</a>). The score is a three-digit number that falls between 300 and 850. The higher the number, the more confidence lenders have that a person will be able to repay their debt on time. Although other companies provide credit scores, the FICO is the dominant score used in the industry.</p>
<p>About 60% of people have scores of 700 or more. At 720, a person is considered a safe risk and typically receives a loan without a problem and at a low interest rate. The FICO score is weighted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>35% payment history</strong>. Having a long history of making payments on time and no missed payments on all credit accounts is one of the top things that creditors look for.</li>
<li>
<strong>30% amount owed</strong>. This area measures the amount someone owes relative to all of the credit they have available to them. If a person is very close to the limit on all lines of credit, they can be deemed a potential risk in the ability to repay their debts on time.</li>
<li>
<strong>15% length of credit history</strong>. In general, a credit report containing a list of accounts opened for a long time will help a person's credit score. The score considers one's oldest account and the average age of all accounts.</li>
<li>
<strong>10% new credit</strong>. Opening several new credit accounts in a short period of time can result in a lowered credit score. Multiple credit report inquiries can represent a greater risk, but this does not include any requests made by the individual, an employer, or a lender who does so when sending the individual an unsolicited, "pre-approved" credit offer. In addition, to compensate for rate shopping, the score counts multiple inquiries in any 14-day period as just one inquiry.</li>
<li>
<strong>10% types of credit in use</strong>. A person's mix of credit cards, retail accounts, finance company loans, and mortgage loans is evaluated.</li>
</ul>
