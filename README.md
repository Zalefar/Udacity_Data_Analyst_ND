##Udacity Data Analyst Nano-Degree Projects
####*Repository for Udacity Data Analyst Nano-Degree Projects*  

**Purpose** :   
This GitHub repository was created as a portfolio into which I intend to place my projects from Udacity's Nano-Degree program. 
If your goal is to learn the material yourself then I would suggest looking into Udacity's program. If you're interested in using any of the code, you are forewarned that this code was created within the context of learning and understanding and may not be suitable for production. Furthermore skeleton files were provided by Udacity and come attached with their use license (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License). 

To view the projects please navigate to the relevent directory; ipython notebooks filenames will include project number for reference.

##Requirements  
Suggest Continuum Analytics Anaconda python distribution ([http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads)) 
for science, math, engineering, data analysis. This distribution will allow you to run the ipython notebooks and most of the 
modules used within.   
*Note*:
>Further packages may be neccessary but will be made clear in the ipython notebook file for each of the projects. I did not set 
up the notebook to automatically download any missing packages therefore if you are missing any of the required modules I suggest that you use Anaconda's `conda` binary package manager to install and update any of the necessary modules. e.g In a terminal `conda install {ggplot}` {insert relevent package here sans the braces} or `conda update {ggplot}`

Installation instructions for Anaconda's python distribution can be found here: [http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html]

*(work in progress... will continue to expand upon)    
*(To do: add a 'getting started', add 'credit and reference information' links Udacity courses, add license info, add contact info)
