# My Udacity Data Analyst Nano-Degree Projects
####*Repository for Udacity Data Analyst Nano-Degree Projects*  

**Purpose** :   
This GitHub repository was created as a portfolio into which I intend to place my projects from Udacity's Nano-Degree program. 
As a consquence the value of this respository will likely be to those other Udacity students taking the same course 
and looking for references or to the instructors looking for their students work. If your goal is to learn the material yourself 
then I would suggest looking into Udacity's program. If you're interested in using any of the code, you are forewarned that 
this code was created within the context of learning and understanding not production and as such may not be very robust, 
defensive, or the most efficient implementation. Furthermore skeleton files were provided by Udacity and come attached with their 
use license (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License). 

To view the projects please open up the relevent ipython notebook; notebooks filenames will include project number for reference. 
For each project there exists short-questions-and-answer notebooks, whose filenames are also labeled for project number reference.
All other files excluding the README are in support of the ipython notebook projects. 

##Requirements  
Suggest Continuum Analytics Anaconda python distribution ([http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads)) 
for science, math, engineering, data analysis. This distribution will allow you to run the ipython notebooks and most of the 
modules used within.   
*Note*:
>Further packages may be neccessary but will be made clear in the ipython notebook file for each of the projects. I did not set 
up the notebook to automatically download any missing packages therefore if you are missing any of the required modules I suggest that you use 
Anaconda's `conda` binary package manager to install and update any of the necessary modules. e.g In a terminal `conda install {ggplot}` {insert 
relevent package here sans the braces} or `conda update {ggplot}`

Installation instructions for Anaconda's python distribution can be found here: [http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html]
(http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html)

*(work in progress... will add to as I progress further into course)    
*(To do: add a 'getting started', add 'credit and reference information' links Udacity courses, add license info, add contact info)
