# Project 3 -- Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data   
Uses data munging techniques to analyse the Seattle Area Eastide. Assesses the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity. Use and subsequently clean OpenStreetMap data to accomplish in the pursuit of this task.

> The OSM data files used in this project are not included in the repository owing to their size exceeding 100MBs. I have included a 'sample.osm' file which reflects the osm file format and content. If you wish to implement the code in the ipython noteboks you will have to follow the provided links in the ipython notebook and download the dataset into the same directory as the notebooks. 

The following files found in this directory are all the files related to this project with the exception of the note above, which recommends that if you run the notebook on your machine to download the full dataset to this directory.
