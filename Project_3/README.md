#Exploratory Data Analysis with Prosper Data set   
The files herein contain the R project .rmd and knitr .html files for the exploratory data analysis. The remaining documents contain supporting documentation and reference materials used in the analysis. The projects' file heirarchy is tied to my set up, therefore if this project was downloaded the working directory information might have to be changed in order to run it.
