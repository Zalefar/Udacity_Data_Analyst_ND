> The OSM data files used in this project are not included in the repository owing to their size exceeding 100MBs. I have included a 'sample.osm' file which reflects the osm file format and content. If you wish to implement the code in the ipython noteboks you will have to follow the provided links in the ipython notebook and download the dataset into the same directory as the notebooks.
