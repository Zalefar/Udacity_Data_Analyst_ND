#Project 1 -- The Science of Decisions  
****
*Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Provides good intuition for the data and uses statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.*

The files in this directory contain the project itself in an ipyhton notebook (also an .html version) format along with the files used as resources during the course of the project. Assuming an anaconda python distro. installed you should be able to run the notebook on your personal machine.        

`Project_1_The_Science_of_Decsions.{ipynb,html}`:              
	The project in its entirety. 

`Statistics_Project1_Instructions.pdf`:         
	The goals and required outcome of the project.

`Understanding the Dependent t Test.pdf`:       
	Resource referred to when implementing and explaining the t-test. 

`stroopdata.csv`:          
	The data upon which the project was constructed.    

> .csv file is assumed to be the stroop data. adding additional csv files to this directory will cause problems if you wish to run the ipy. notebook.
