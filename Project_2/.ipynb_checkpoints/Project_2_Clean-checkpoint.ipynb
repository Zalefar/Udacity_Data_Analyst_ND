    "Utilizing lesson 6 auditing procedures as a guide I created my own provisional auditing code process and analyzed the OSM data for Seattle WA, USA. More specifically the East-side of the greater Seattle area and discovered roughly 725,000 entries containing 460 unique tag key/value pairs for OSM data primitives 'ways' and 'nodes'. Similar to the lesson 6 auditing challenges I focused my attention on the address related tags to perform a more in-depth analysis and auditing. In this data set 'addr'(address) tags along with 149 other unique tags were hierarchical, specifically the 'parent' tag 'addr' contained further components. The 'addr' tags included 10 'child' tags related to addresses, I specifically audited:   \n",

    "* addr:city   \n",
    "* addr:postcode  \n",

    "The key issues I focused on in this audit were abbreviated street addresses, inconsistent and invalid postcode values, Invalid state name abbreviations, and invalid city names.

    "After auditing, inserting and reviewing this data set I am left with several thoughts. First, meta-data is often not inserted along with GPS coordinates, there were nearly 725,000 total documents but when reviewing what and how many tags are to be found in these documents the most frequent tags outside of `type` are seen less then 40,000 times. This conclusion was reaffirmed when reviewing the address tags, which suggested that most submitted GPS coordinates do not contain additional tags providing meta-data about the GPS coordinates. If we are looking to use OSM data for more then just GPS directions much more work will be necessary to provide greater depth and value. For the meta-data that I audited a great amount of it was added by several users, likely these documents were inserted in bulk from another geo-locational database.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I found that at least as it concerns address information that OSM could presumably with little effort automatically fill out zip-code, city name, state, and country information using nothing more then the submitted GPS data and an API call to a government website containing location data, which are free and easily accessible. Additionally offering perhaps a uniform  and semi-standard list of tag keys and a framework or guideline for tag values for users would likely create a much cleaner and more easily searchable database. Finally given that businesses or organizations whose mission revolves around the collection and storage of geo-located data with strong meta-data can contribute the most value to OSM, developing inducements for these types of organization to export their data to OSM seems worthwhile. Crowd sourcing geo-located data is fairly straight forward, but crowd sourcing the meta-data is much messier and clearly not as effective given the low submission rates of additional meta-data. I could be that providing a framework and some guidelines that are simple to fill out might encourage otherwise uninterested contributors to spend just a few moments more to provide meta-data about their GPS coordinates. Incentivizing this behavior would benefit the entire OSM community, making it a more valuable resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OSM dataset has the potential to offer a lot of value to individuals who may otherwise be priced out of the type of information that could be contained in these datasets. If OSM were to explain the potential value of rich meta-data and how it can benefit the users of OSM maps, they might be able to achieve higher rates of meta-data submission. In terms of providing clean standard data, Implementing auditing methods after the fact will work as evidenced by my auditing process above but it would certainly be easier and likely cheaper to simply enforce certain standards and guidelines for inserting data to begin with. Providing some incentive to those users who not only contribute but also adhere to meta-data guidelines could increase the submission of clean meta-data.\n"
